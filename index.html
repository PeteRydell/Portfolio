        <p> Hi, my name is Peter Rydell and I'm an aspiring coder living and working in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Prior to moving to LA, I worked in Washington D.C. for four years in public affairs consulting on behalf of primarily government and defense clients. It's there where I started to fall in love with web development, with several initial projects focused on client website curation. I've remained in the same field during my time in California, but my work now focuses on media relations for consumer tech companies such as Sony Electronics and Riot Games.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I graduated from Sewanee in 2014 with a BA in International and Global Studies as well as a minor in Political Science. I'm a lifelong Cleveland Browns fan, avid movie-goer and foodie.
