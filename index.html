            <p class=bio> Hi, my name is Peter Rydell and I'm an aspiring coder living and working in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
            <br>
            <p class=bio>Prior to moving to LA, I worked in Washington D.C. for four years in public affairs consulting on behalf of primarily government, trade association and defense clients. It's there where I started to develop an interest in coding and web development, with several initial projects focused on client website curation. I still work for the same company in California, but my focus is now on media relations in the consumer tech space with companies such as Sony Electronics and Riot Games.</p>
            <br>
            <p class=bio>I graduated from Sewanee in 2014 with a BA in International and Global Studies as well as a minor in Political Science. I'm a lifelong Cleveland Browns fan, avid movie-goer and foodie. I love dogs - I have a fresh puppy named Murray, I hate sour cream and I'm one for two in eating competitions.
